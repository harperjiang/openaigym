## Mountain Car
In the mountain car task, the agent is required to move a car uphill to a flag.
Unfortunately, the engine is not powerful enough to make the move directly.
Instead, you need to utilize the U shape hill to accumulate some energy before
you can reach the flag.

We use the SARSA algorithm introduced in *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*
by R.S. Sutton and A.G. Barto, Chapter 10.
